# quiz-api

Quiz API is the nickname for the API in charge of handling Everybody Votes Channel. It is essentially RiiConnect24's EVC system, but written in Go instead of Python for the sake of:

- Running it on Google App Engine - less downtime, automatic restarts

- Simply more efficient

This is currently a work in progress and is not finished. The code is incomplete and Spotlight and I are working on finishing this at our own pace. I'm not experienced enough in Golang to write this all in one go on my own but the eventual goal is for EVC to be working on Disconnect24 as a more stable and efficient service.

## Cool! When will it be ready for me to try?

When it's done. Since I am still relatively new to Go and Spotlight is occupied with other areas of the project, it may take a while until this is in a working, beta or finished state.
